AutoPatchWork Mod
==========

This addon automatically loads next pages in multi-paged articles and appends  
them to the current when scrolling to the end of it.

AutoPatchWork Mod is derivative of [AutoPatchWork](https://github.com/os0x/AutoPatchWork) which was inspired by [AutoPagerize](http://autopagerize.net).
